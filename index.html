My work experience includes gaining valuable work experience as an Instructional Assistant Substitute in Special Education at the Riverside Unified School District since December 2022 and continuing to the present day. Under the direction of an assigned supervisor, assist a certificated teacher in providing instruction to individual or small groups of severely, physically or visually handicapped students in a classroom. One of the key responsibilities in my role is to closely monitor and report on student progress, both in terms of their behavior and academic performance. By keeping a keen eye on their development, I am able to provide valuable insights to the teacher and other relevant professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the students' educational plans.I assist students in developing various self-help, social and community skills. This experience has not only shaped my understanding of the challenges faced by these students but has also fueled my passion for making a positive difference in their lives.
During my tenure as a Barista Trainer at Starbucks from July 2019 to December 2022, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the art of handcrafting delicious beverages while building meaningful relationships with both customers and fellow partners.  I worked in demanding, fast-paced restaurant environments. Specialized in sales and respond to customer trends, needs, and comments to drive quality experience and enhance future sales. One of my key responsibilities as a trainer was to coach and guide new employees, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in their roles. I developed effective advertising strategies and instructed them on how to leverage upselling opportunities to maximize sales. Moreover, I trained them to efficiently operate the point-of-sale (POS) systems, manage inventory, maintain a clean and organized environment, and process payments accurately. By providing comprehensive training, I empowered new employees to deliver exceptional service and contribute to the success of the store. In addition to training new hires, I also played a pivotal role in assigning duties, responsibilities, and workstations to employees based on their skills and the operational requirements. By carefully considering individual strengths and work requirements, I ensured that the team operated seamlessly and efficiently, providing a positive work environment for everyone involved.						
During my time as a member of Jamba Juice from February 2018 to June 2019, I had the privilege of delivering an exceptional customer experience while ensuring the highest quality of products. I prepared beverages for individuals with special dietary needs using proper safety precautions and sanitary measures. To maintain consistency and accuracy in my work, I meticulously selected and measured ingredients using precise measurements and balance scales. This attention to detail allowed me to achieve the perfect balance of flavors and proportions, resulting in beverages that were both visually appealing and well-balanced in taste.<br><br>
During my educational journey, I had the privilege of attending Norco College from August 2017 to July 2021, where I pursued my academic goals and obtained an Associate's Degree in Social and Behavior Studies. One notable aspect of my educational experience at Norco College is that I began my community college studies during my sophomore year of high school. This early start allowed me to embark on my academic pursuits ahead of schedule and by taking advantage of this unique opportunity, I was able to maximize my time at Norco College and delve deeper into my chosen area of study. Graduating with Dean's Honors with Distinction is a testament to my commitment to academic excellence and my passion for knowledge. The interdisciplinary nature of my studies equipped me with a broad understanding of social dynamics and human behavior, while my engagement in extracurricular activities helped me develop important skills beyond the classroom.						
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology at the esteemed University of California, Riverside, where I have been actively engaged in my studies since September 2021. With my studies at the University of California, Riverside, still in progress, I am eagerly looking forward to the culmination of my undergraduate journey in the summer of 2023. As I approach the conclusion of my program, I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired throughout my coursework to real-world situations, making a positive impact in the field of psychology. The curriculum of the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology program at the University of California, Riverside, has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the human mind, behavior, and the intricate workings of the human psyche.
